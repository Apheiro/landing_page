# Landing Page (⌐■_■)

In the project, unlike the previous one, he shows us an image of the web that he wants us to make and clarifies that it is not necessary to make it identical. Well... I set out to make it identical to the reference image. I am going to use all the experience of the previous project, in which I encountered several problems and in which I learned more about CSS and HTML. Here is the result of my [Landing_Page](apheiro.github.io/landing_page/).

Acquired knowledge:</br>
● Better use of markup language.</br>
● More understanding of boxing and the positioning of texts.</br>
● More properties learned in CSS.</br>
